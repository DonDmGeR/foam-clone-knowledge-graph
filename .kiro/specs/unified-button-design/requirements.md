# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a unified, modern glow button design across the entire Knowledge Graph Visualizer application. The design features a purple/violet color scheme with glowing effects, hover animations, and consistent styling that replaces all existing button styles throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all buttons in the application to have a consistent, modern design so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any button in the application THEN it SHALL display with the unified glow design
2. WHEN I hover over any button THEN it SHALL show the glow hover effect with color inversion
3. WHEN I click any button THEN it SHALL show the active/pressed state with reduced glow
4. WHEN a button is disabled THEN it SHALL show a muted version of the design with reduced opacity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want buttons to maintain their functionality while having the new design so that the application continues to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buttons are restyled THEN they SHALL retain all existing click handlers and functionality
2. WHEN buttons have icons THEN the icons SHALL be properly positioned within the new design
3. WHEN buttons have loading states THEN the loading indicators SHALL work with the new design
4. WHEN buttons are in different sizes (small, medium, large) THEN they SHALL scale appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the button design to work well in both light and dark themes so that the interface remains usable in all theme modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is in light theme THEN buttons SHALL use appropriate colors for light backgrounds
2. WHEN the application is in dark theme THEN buttons SHALL use appropriate colors for dark backgrounds
3. WHEN switching between themes THEN button colors SHALL transition smoothly
4. WHEN buttons are focused THEN they SHALL show appropriate focus indicators for accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the button styling to be maintainable and reusable so that future button additions are consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new buttons are added THEN they SHALL automatically inherit the unified design
2. WHEN button variants are needed (primary, secondary, danger) THEN they SHALL use the same base design with color variations
3. WHEN the design needs updates THEN changes SHALL be centralized and affect all buttons
4. WHEN buttons need custom sizing THEN the design SHALL accommodate different dimensions
