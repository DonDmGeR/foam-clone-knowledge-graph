# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Advanced Editor Features in the Foam Clone knowledge graph visualizer. The goal is to enhance the markdown editing experience with modern editor capabilities including syntax highlighting, live preview, auto-completion, and intelligent wikilink suggestions. These features will significantly improve the user experience when creating and editing markdown notes directly within the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want syntax highlighting in the markdown editor, so that I can easily distinguish between different markdown elements and write more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a markdown file in the editor THEN the system SHALL highlight markdown syntax elements with distinct colors
2. WHEN a user types markdown syntax THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting in real-time
3. WHEN the user switches between light and dark themes THEN the syntax highlighting SHALL adapt to maintain readability
4. WHEN a user edits existing markdown content THEN the syntax highlighting SHALL update dynamically as they type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want a live preview of my markdown content, so that I can see how my formatted text will appear without switching between edit and preview modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables live preview mode THEN the system SHALL display a side-by-side view with raw markdown and rendered content
2. WHEN a user types in the markdown editor THEN the preview SHALL update automatically with a short delay
3. WHEN a user scrolls in the editor THEN the preview SHALL synchronize its scroll position
4. WHEN a user clicks on an element in the preview THEN the editor SHALL focus on the corresponding source text
5. WHEN the sidebar space is limited THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle to switch between edit-only and preview-only modes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a note-taker, I want auto-completion for existing file names, so that I can quickly reference other notes without remembering exact file names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts typing a filename THEN the system SHALL suggest matching files from the current directory structure
2. WHEN a user types partial text THEN the system SHALL show fuzzy-matched suggestions based on file names
3. WHEN a user selects a suggestion THEN the system SHALL insert the complete filename at the cursor position
4. WHEN no matches are found THEN the system SHALL display a "no matches" indicator
5. WHEN a user presses Escape THEN the auto-completion popup SHALL close without inserting text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want intelligent wikilink suggestions when creating connections between notes, so that I can easily discover and link related content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types "[[" THEN the system SHALL automatically show a dropdown with available files for linking
2. WHEN a user continues typing after "[[" THEN the system SHALL filter suggestions based on the typed text
3. WHEN a user selects a suggestion THEN the system SHALL complete the wikilink with proper closing brackets
4. WHEN a user types "]]" manually THEN the system SHALL recognize it as a completed wikilink
5. WHEN a wikilink references a non-existent file THEN the system SHALL highlight it differently to indicate a broken link
6. WHEN a user hovers over a wikilink THEN the system SHALL show a preview tooltip with the target file's content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a power user, I want keyboard shortcuts for common formatting actions, so that I can format text quickly without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+B (Cmd+B on Mac) THEN the system SHALL toggle bold formatting for selected text or at cursor position
2. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+I (Cmd+I on Mac) THEN the system SHALL toggle italic formatting for selected text or at cursor position
3. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on Mac) THEN the system SHALL create a link format around selected text or at cursor position
4. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+Shift+C (Cmd+Shift+C on Mac) THEN the system SHALL format selected text as inline code
5. WHEN a user presses Tab with text selected THEN the system SHALL indent the selected lines
6. WHEN a user presses Shift+Tab with text selected THEN the system SHALL unindent the selected lines

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a writer, I want smart indentation and list continuation, so that I can create well-formatted lists and nested content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses Enter at the end of a list item THEN the system SHALL automatically create a new list item with the same indentation
2. WHEN a user presses Enter on an empty list item THEN the system SHALL remove the list marker and return to normal text
3. WHEN a user presses Tab at the beginning of a list item THEN the system SHALL increase the indentation level
4. WHEN a user presses Shift+Tab at the beginning of a list item THEN the system SHALL decrease the indentation level
5. WHEN a user creates nested lists THEN the system SHALL use appropriate markers (-, *, +) for different levels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code block syntax highlighting, so that I can include properly formatted code snippets in my notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a fenced code block with a language identifier THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting for that language
2. WHEN a user types within a code block THEN the system SHALL maintain proper indentation and formatting
3. WHEN a user pastes code into a code block THEN the system SHALL preserve the original formatting
4. WHEN a code block has no language specified THEN the system SHALL display it with basic monospace formatting
5. WHEN the system encounters an unsupported language THEN it SHALL fall back to generic code formatting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a note organizer, I want search and replace functionality within the editor, so that I can efficiently update content across my notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) THEN the system SHALL open a search dialog within the editor
2. WHEN a user enters search text THEN the system SHALL highlight all matches in the current document
3. WHEN a user presses Enter or clicks "Find Next" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next match
4. WHEN a user opens replace mode THEN the system SHALL provide options to replace current match or all matches
5. WHEN a user performs replace all THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation with the number of replacements made
6. WHEN a user presses Escape THEN the search dialog SHALL close and clear all highlights
